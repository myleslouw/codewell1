            <h2>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h2>
            <p>The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to develop a
                skillset
                that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.</p>
            <p>Im proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young
                minds
                about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities</p>
            <p>As a developer, you have everuthing available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.</p>
            <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.
                "How big would you dream, if you <b>knew</b> you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone though the
                hardest
                parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're
                passionate about.</p>
            <p>Im happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.</p>
